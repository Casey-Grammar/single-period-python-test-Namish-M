# Task 04 - Expand Subject Codes
# Write a function called expand_subject_codes(codes)
# that takes a list of short subject codes and returns a new list
# with the full subject names.
#
# Use the following code table:
# ENG -> English
# MAT -> Mathematics
# SCI -> Science
# HIS -> History
# ART -> Art
#
# If a code is not recognised, ignore it.
#
# Example:
# expand_subject_codes(["MAT", "SCI", "XYZ", "ENG"])
# returns ["Mathematics", "Science", "English"]
